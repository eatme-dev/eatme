<p>Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she
opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words “*<strong>EAT
ME</strong>” were beautifully marked in currants.
“Well, I’ll eat it,” said Alice, “and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach
the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either
way I’ll get into the garden, and I don’t care which happens!”

# Description

In online documentation, all code examples in that involve inputs and outputs should be interactive.
It should be trivial for a documentation author to create interactive examples.
The interactive layouts should be completely and easily configurable.

EatMe is a project to make this a reality.
